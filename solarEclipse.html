        <h1>Solar Eclipse</h1>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>Solar Eclipses happen about every 18 months.</p>

        <p>These happen when the moon goes in front of the sun.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p></p>

        <p></p>

        <h2>Tips:</h2>

        <p>Never look straight into the sun.</p>

        <p>Solar Eclipse glasses can be purchased so you can safely look into the sun.</p>

        <p>Make sure to purchase them early, they'll sell out!</p>

        <p>There are only certain places where you can experience totality - these will be crowded.</p>

        <h2>Have fun while staying safe!</h2>
